# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about ...

What it's like to be a college graduate with a 2 year degree in mechatronics, kicking himself in the ass
for not pursuing a CS degree like he originally planned. After 12 years of welding and wanting to make a change, 
having a goal, then deciding that something looks like the best of both worlds, is not the way to go about it.
